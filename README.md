# SQL-Practice
PostgreSQL practice SQL scripts for learning and experimenting with database queries.
# Employee Database (PostgreSQL Practice)

This project contains SQL queries for practicing PostgreSQL.  
I created a sample `employee5` table and wrote queries for:

- Filtering with WHERE
- Aggregations (AVG, COUNT, GROUP BY)
- Subqueries (MAX salary per department)
- Sorting (ORDER BY, LIMIT)
- Window Functions (RANK per department)

## How to Run
1. Create the database and table using `employee5_queries.sql`
2. Run the queries step by step in PostgreSQL
